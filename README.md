### Introduction;

I designed 3 different modes for the PS4 Game Controller. The **default mode** can be used to play any instrument that you drag into the **default mode** Track.
The **GuZheng mode** can be used to play specially technique(Finger Rolling). 
Also, I set up vibration for the **Options Button** and **Share Button**, making the player feel the rumble as a reminder that they have switched modes.
        
  

### How to play

1. when you first open files, the mode was set as default mode.
2. Press **Options** button to switch to GuZheng Mode(when you feel vibration from the PS4 controller, it means it works)
3. Press **Share** button to switch to Percussion Mode(when you feel vibration from the PS4 controller, it means it works)
